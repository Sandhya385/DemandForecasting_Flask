# ðŸ“ˆ Demand Forecasting with Flask API & Power BI

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project predicts future demand for a single product based on 3.5 years of historical sales data.  
The forecasting is performed using **SARIMAX** and **XGBoost**, deployed as a Flask API, and visualized in Power BI.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- **Time Series Forecasting** using SARIMAX & XGBoost
- **Flask API Deployment** on Render
- **Interactive Power BI Dashboard**
- Forecast accuracy evaluation using RMSE & MAE

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Cleaned & prepared 3.5 years of historical data.
2. **Model Training** â€“ Built SARIMAX & XGBoost models.
3. **Forecasting** â€“ Predicted demand for the next 7 days.
4. **Deployment** â€“ Hosted Flask API on Render.
5. **Visualization** â€“ Created Power BI dashboard for results.
